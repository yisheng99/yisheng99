âœ¨ Hi, Iâ€™m Yi Sheng. Welcome to my coding space. I am currently an economist/macro analyst.

ðŸ“™ While explaining the World through macroeconomic analysis is my bread and butter, I occasionally spend time on developing trading strategies.
I aim to constantly improve my quantitative and macro research process to craft better trading strategies. 

ðŸ‘€ As such, you can find my coding pieces, mostly on economic/finance/investments here.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me via Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/yapyisheng/ if you are interested in what I do.
